.SH NAME
mseed2ascii \- miniSEED to ASCII converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mseed2ascii [options] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmseed2ascii\fP converts miniSEED time-series data to ASCII format.
By default all aspects of the input files are automatically detected
(record length, byte order, etc.).  If an input file name is prefixed
with an '@' character the file is assumed to contain a list of input
data files, see \fILIST FILES\fP below.

A separate output file is written for each continuous time-series in
the input data.  Output file names are of the form:

.nf
"Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual.YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.FFFFFF.txt"
.fi

.nf
For example:
"TA.ELFS..LHZ.R.2006-04-22T153619.000000.txt"
.fi

If the input file name is "-" input miniSEED records will be read
from standard input.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Print program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-r \fIbytes\fP"
Specify the miniSEED record length in \fIbytes\fP, by default this is
autodetected.

.IP "-dr        "
Use the sampling rate derived from the start and end times and the
number of samples instead of the rate specified in the input data.
This is useful when the sample rate in the input data does not have
enough resolution to represent the true rate.

.IP "-i         "
Process each input file individually.  By default all input files are
read and all data is buffered in memory before ASCII files are written.
This allows time-series spanning mutilple input files to be merged and
written in a single ASCII file.  The intention is to use this option
when processing large amounts of data in order to keep memory usage
within reasonable limits.

.IP "-tt \fIsecs\fP"
Specify a time tolerance for constructing continous trace segments.
The tolerance is specified in seconds.  The default tolerance is 1/2
of the sample period.

.IP "-rt \fIdiff\fP"
Specify a sample rate tolerance for constructing continous trace
segments.  The tolerance is specified as the difference between two
sampling rates.  The default tolerance is tested as: (abs(1-sr1/sr2) <
0.0001).

.IP "-o \fIoutfile\fP"
Write all ASCII output to \fIoutfile\fP, if \fIoutfile\fP is a single
dash (-) then all output will go to stdout.  If this option is not
specified each contiguous segment is written to a separate file.  All
diagnostic output from the program is written to stderr and should
never get mixed with data going to stdout.

.IP "-G         "
Produce GeoCSV formatted output. With this option multi-column sample
lists are not allowed, i.e. the \fB-c\fP option is ignored.

.IP "-f \fIformat\fP"
The default output format is sample list.  This option applies to all
output files:

.nf
1 : Sample list format, header includes time stamp of first
2 : Time-sample pair format, each sample value listed with time stamp
.fi

.IP "-c \fIcols\fP"
Specify the number of columns to use for sample list formatted output,
default is 1 column.

.IP "-u \fIunits\fP"
Specify the units string that should be included in the ASCII output
headers, the default is "Counts".

.IP "-z \fIzipfile\fP"
Create a ZIP archive containing all SAC files instead of writing
individual files.  Each file is compressed with the deflate method.
Specify \fB"-"\fP (dash) to write ZIP archive to stdout.

.IP "-z0 \fIzipfile\fP"
Same as \fI"-z"\fP except do not compress the SAC files.  Specify
\fB"-"\fP (dash) to write ZIP archive to stdout.

.SH LIST FILES
If an input file is prefixed with an '@' character the file is assumed
to contain a list of file for input.  Multiple list files can be
combined with multiple input files on the command line.  The last,
space separated field on each line is assumed to be the file name to
be read.

An example of a simple text list:

.nf
TA.ELFS..LHE.R.mseed
TA.ELFS..LHN.R.mseed
TA.ELFS..LHZ.R.mseed
